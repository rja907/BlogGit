### React-Router-Dom

To support navigation in the application by tying different components 'to' different paths!

Also, we used the React-Router with Action Creators!

#### ownProps

They are the second argument in the mapStateToProps function.
These are the set of props that are going to the target component.

#### Lodash mapKeys

We used them to treat our state object as an object rather than an array!
This made fetching data and manipulation of data easy.
